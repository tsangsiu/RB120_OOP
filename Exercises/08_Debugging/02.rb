# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# Further Exploration

The `FlightlessBird#initialize` method is not necessary. When it is called, by
the method lookup chain, the `super` keyword will eventually lead to invocation
of `Animal#initialize` method with all arguments pass to it.

Without the `FlightlessBird` method, Ruby will still invoke `Animal#initialize`
by the method lookup chain.
