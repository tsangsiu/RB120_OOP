My original solution
Technically it does the job, but object-wise, motorboats are not a subclass of catamaran
=end

# class Catamaran
#   include Movable
  
#   attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

#   def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
#     self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
#     self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
#     # ... code omitted ...

# class Motorboat < Catamaran

#     super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
