### Textual Description

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses
one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves
will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock

If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.
